Here is a script to check the basic health status of a linux system.

This script has been tested to run successfully on RHEL7/6/5.x, Cent OS, SLES 12/11, Ubuntu 14 x86 and x86_64 bit architectures. It may work on other variants as well, however, not tested. These tests were run on virtual machines.

This is a small, light weight script which makes use of native Linux utilities to get the required details and doesn't need much space."
